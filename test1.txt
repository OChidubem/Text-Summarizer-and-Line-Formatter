The main issues were related to how we modeled the states and 
transitions in the FSM (Finite State Machine) for the Warehouse GUI system, and how we 
explained non-FSM aspects. Password Authentication Is Not a Separate State 
In our FSM model, we included “password authentication” as part of the Login state process. The 
professor explained that password authentication is a process, not a new user interface state. While the system waits for the authentication result, the user cannot interact with the interface 
so it’s part of the transition from S0 (Login) to another state, not a state itself. Correction: we will Keep only the main UI panels (Login, Manager, Salesclerk, Client, Sub-Panel, 
Logout/Exit) as states. The professor advised simplifying the diagram to show only major states and transitions: 
S0 → S1/S2/S3 based on login credentials 
S1 → S2 (“Become Salesclerk”) 
S2 → S3 (“Become Client”) 
S3 → S4 (Sub-panel selection)S1/S2/S3/S4 → S5 (Logout/Quit) 
Correction: we will redraw the state transition diagram clearly, removing unnecessary 
operational details and making transitions distinct and readable. Correction: We should make it clearer in our explanation that these interactions take 
place inside a state and that the FSM only changes in response to changes made to the 
main panel.
