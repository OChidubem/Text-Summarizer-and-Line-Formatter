Assignment: Project 2 analysis reflection 
 
After watching the Oct 14 feedback video, I realized that several corrections are needed in my Project 2 Analysis document. The main issues were related to how we modeled the states and 
transitions in the FSM (Finite State Machine) for the Warehouse GUI system, and how we 
explained non-FSM aspects. Below is a detailed summary of what needs to be corrected. 

1. Password Authentication Is Not a Separate State 
In our FSM model, we included “password authentication” as part of the Login state process. The 
professor explained that password authentication is a process, not a new user interface state. 
While the system waits for the authentication result, the user cannot interact with the interface 
so it’s part of the transition from S0 (Login) to another state, not a state itself. 
Correction: we will Remove “authentication” as a separate step in the FSM table and diagram. 
Instead, model it as part of the transition between S0 → S1/S2/S3. 

2. Clarifying Processes vs. States 
We treated several operations (like “modify sale price,” “add client,” “view product,” etc.) as 
states. The professor explained that these are processes or dialogues that occur within a state 
(e.g., Manager Panel or Salesclerk Panel). They do not cause a change in the overall UI pane; 
they are just use cases executed from that state. 
Correction: we will Keep only the main UI panels (Login, Manager, Salesclerk, Client, Sub-Panel, 
Logout/Exit) as states. Treat sub-operations as internal processes, not as transitions or new 
states. 

3. State Diagram Simplification 
Our original diagram was cluttered with too many transitions and overlapping arrows, making it 
difficult to read. 
The professor advised simplifying the diagram to show only major states and transitions: 
S0 → S1/S2/S3 based on login credentials 
S1 → S2 (“Become Salesclerk”) 
S2 → S3 (“Become Client”) 
S3 → S4 (Sub-panel selection)S1/S2/S3/S4 → S5 (Logout/Quit) 
Correction: we will redraw the state transition diagram clearly, removing unnecessary 
operational details and making transitions distinct and readable. 

4. Taking Care of Login Origin Context Memory 
According to the professor, FSMs have no memory, which means they can't recall how they 
got to where they are. A manager should return to the manager panel (rather than the login 
screen) when they log out and become a salesclerk, according to our design. To deal with this, 
we can use a small memory object rather than a stack to store context information (like the 
initial login role). 
Correction: For the system to return correctly without utilizing a stack, we will include an 
explanation that we use a "context object" to remember the user's initial login role. 

5. Non-FSM Aspects Adjustments 
Our Non-FSM section included some irrelevant items. The professor clarified: 
i) Data persistence and backend logic are not FSM issues because FSM only controls the 
UI flow. 
ii) Security and authentication are valid but should be explained as backend service calls 
invoked from the login state. 
Correction: we will Remove “data persistence” as a non-FSM concern in this context and focus 
on relevant UI-level issues like authentication, error handling, and concurrency. 

6. Clarification of Dynamic UI 
The professor pointed out that pop-up windows or dialog boxes (for instance, viewing 
product details or editing client information) are UI dialogues inside an existing panel 
rather than new states. 
Correction: We should make it clearer in our explanation that these interactions take 
place inside a state and that the FSM only changes in response to changes made to the 
main panel.

7. Revision of the Summary 
Our summary section can be improved to highlight these corrected concepts: 
Correction: Emphasize that the FSM focuses on UI control flow, while backend tasks like 
authentication, database persistence, and data logic occur independently. The revised 
model should show simpler state transitions and clear separation between UI (FSM) and 
backend systems. 

Conclusion 
Through the professor’s feedback, I learned the importance of distinguishing processes from 
states, keeping the FSM focused on user interface control, and simplifying transitions for clarity. 
The corrected design will make our FSM model more accurate, modular, and aligned with real
world UI behavior.
