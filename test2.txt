Name: CHIDUBEM OKOYE Class: CSCI 430 Assignment: Project 2 analysis reflection
After watching the Oct 14 feedback video, I realized that several corrections
are needed in my Project 2 Analysis document. Below is a detailed summary of
what needs to be corrected. 1. 2. Clarifying Processes vs. States We treated
several operations (like “modify sale price,” “add client,” “view
product,” etc. g. , Manager Panel or Salesclerk Panel). Treat sub-operations
as internal processes, not as transitions or new states. 3. State Diagram
Simplification Our original diagram was cluttered with too many transitions and
overlapping arrows, making it difficult to read. The professor advised
simplifying the diagram to show only major states and transitions: S0 →
S1/S2/S3 based on login credentials S1 → S2 (“Become Salesclerk”) S2 →
S3 (“Become Client”) S3 → S4 (Sub-panel selection)S1/S2/S3/S4 → S5
(Logout/Quit) Correction: we will redraw the state transition diagram clearly,
removing unnecessary operational details and making transitions distinct and
readable. 4. Taking Care of Login Origin Context Memory According to the
professor, FSMs have no memory, which means they can't recall how they got to
where they are. 5. Non-FSM Aspects Adjustments Our Non-FSM section included some
irrelevant items. 6. Clarification of Dynamic UI The professor pointed out that
pop-up windows or dialog boxes (for instance, viewing product details or editing
client information) are UI dialogues inside an existing panel rather than new
states. 7. The corrected design will make our FSM model more accurate, modular,
and aligned with real world UI behavior.
