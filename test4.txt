Name: CHIDUBEM OKOYE Class: CSCI 430 Assignment: Project 2 analysis reflection
After watching the Oct 14 feedback video, I realized that several corrections
are needed in my Project 2 Analysis document. The main issues were related to
how we modeled the states and transitions in the FSM (Finite State Machine) for
the Warehouse GUI system, and how we explained non-FSM aspects. Password
Authentication Is Not a Separate State In our FSM model, we included “password
authentication” as part of the Login state process. While the system waits for
the authentication result, the user cannot interact with the interface so it’s
part of the transition from S0 (Login) to another state, not a state itself.
Clarifying Processes vs. States We treated several operations (like “modify
sale price,” “add client,” “view product,” etc.) as states. The
professor advised simplifying the diagram to show only major states and
transitions: S0 → S1/S2/S3 based on login credentials S1 → S2 (“Become
Salesclerk”) S2 → S3 (“Become Client”) S3 → S4 (Sub-panel
selection)S1/S2/S3/S4 → S5 (Logout/Quit) Correction: we will redraw the state
transition diagram clearly, removing unnecessary operational details and making
transitions distinct and readable. A manager should return to the manager panel
(rather than the login screen) when they log out and become a salesclerk,
according to our design. Correction: For the system to return correctly without
utilizing a stack, we will include an explanation that we use a "context object"
to remember the user's initial login role. Correction: we will Remove “data
persistence” as a non-FSM concern in this context and focus on relevant
UI-level issues like authentication, error handling, and concurrency.
Clarification of Dynamic UI The professor pointed out that pop-up windows or
dialog boxes (for instance, viewing product details or editing client
information) are UI dialogues inside an existing panel rather than new states.
Correction: We should make it clearer in our explanation that these interactions
take place inside a state and that the FSM only changes in response to changes
made to the main panel. Revision of the Summary Our summary section can be
improved to highlight these corrected concepts: Correction: Emphasize that the
FSM focuses on UI control flow, while backend tasks like authentication,
database persistence, and data logic occur independently. Conclusion Through the
professor’s feedback, I learned the importance of distinguishing processes
from states, keeping the FSM focused on user interface control, and simplifying
transitions for clarity. The corrected design will make our FSM model more
accurate, modular, and aligned with real world UI behavior.
