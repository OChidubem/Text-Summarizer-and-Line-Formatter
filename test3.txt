Name: CHIDUBEM OKOYE Class: CSCI 430 Assignment: Project 2 analysis reflection
After watching the Oct 14 feedback video, I realized that several corrections
are needed in my Project 2 Analysis document. Below is a detailed summary of
what needs to be corrected. States We treated several operations (like “modify
sale price,” “add client,” “view product,” etc. They do not cause a
change in the overall UI pane; they are just use cases executed from that state.
State Diagram Simplification Our original diagram was cluttered with too many
transitions and overlapping arrows, making it difficult to read. Taking Care of
Login Origin Context Memory According to the professor, FSMs have no memory,
which means they can't recall how they got to where they are. Non-FSM Aspects
Adjustments Our Non-FSM section included some irrelevant items. Correction: we
will Remove “data persistence” as a non-FSM concern in this context and
focus on relevant UI-level issues like authentication, error handling, and
concurrency. Clarification of Dynamic UI The professor pointed out that pop-up
windows or dialog boxes (for instance, viewing product details or editing client
information) are UI dialogues inside an existing panel rather than new states.
Conclusion Through the professor’s feedback, I learned the importance of
distinguishing processes from states, keeping the FSM focused on user interface
control, and simplifying transitions for clarity. The corrected design will make
our FSM model more accurate, modular, and aligned with real world UI behavior.
