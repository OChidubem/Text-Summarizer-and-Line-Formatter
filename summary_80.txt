Artificial intelligence is transforming industries around the world. Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Computer vision enables systems to interpret and analyze images and video. Data scientists work with large datasets to train and validate machine learning models. The ethical implications of artificial intelligence are increasingly important as the technology becomes more widespread. Governments are developing regulations to ensure AI systems are safe, fair, and transparent.
